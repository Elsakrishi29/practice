	<b><i><p>Graph theory has a very significant part for performance in image processing in particular image segmentation. Image segmentation is a process of separating a digital image into its integral regions or segments which further is useful in analysis of an image.</p></center></i></b>

	<h2><u>DEFINITION</u></h2>
	<p>Graph is a mathematical representation of a network and it describes the relationship between lines and points.<br> A graph consists of some points and lines between them. <br>The length of the lines and position of the points do not matter. <br>Each object in a graph is called a node.</p>

	<h3><ins>GRAPH DEFINITION</ins></h3>
	<p>A graph G is called a <b>order pair</b> (V(G),E(G)) consisting of a nonempty sedt V(G) of vertices, a set E(G), disjoint from V(G) with each edge of G an unorderd pair of <small><i>(not necessarily distinct)</i></small>vertices of G.</p>
